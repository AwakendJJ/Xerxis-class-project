- **Event Details**: Displays event name, date, time, and location.
- **Attendees List**: Shows a list of addresses that have RSVPed to the event.
- **Countdown Timer**: Visual countdown to the event date.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract will be written in Solidity and implements basic RSVP functionality:

- **Display Event**: Display event details including name, date, and RSVP fee.
- **RSVP**: Users can RSVP by paying little gas fee.
- **List Attendees**: Retrieve the list of RSVPed addresses.
